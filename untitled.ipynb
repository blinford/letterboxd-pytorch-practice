      "Michael Powell named Black Narcissus his most erotic film and it’s easy to see why. The opulence of the palace set teetering 9000 feet high up in the Himalayas threatens to overwhelm the strait-laced nuns.

The local Englishman, Mr Dean, gets about in schoolboy shorts while riding a miniature horse, and if that’s not some weird sexual fantasy dreamed up by repressed…<sep>another day working at the sisterhood. everyone keeps asking me if they can fuck the bell. buddy, they wont even let me fuck it<sep>that man was not hot enough for those women to be acting so crazy<sep>I always think about how perfect some classics would be if it weren't for the racism and brownface.

Kerr is superb as the young sister superior whose buried memories are evoked by the whipping wind, Kathleen Byron explosive as her lipsticked flipside: the horny, heavy-lidded Sister Ruth, not cut out for this life. It's witty and wild, and not a bit like anything else: impossibly British but with its eyes…<sep>Enjoyed it more than I thought but it didn’t blow me away by any account. Brilliant timely cinematography and a classic story that draws its audience in, I can see why it’s a notable classic but I couldn’t find anything really to connect with I was just taken in by the storytelling and brilliant direction.

What our pious Sisters experience in Black Narcissus is in no way caused by the palace of Mopu, for Mopu is but a catalyst for unleashing tense feelings of desire that have been boiling under the surface of our Sisters’ psyches for years prior to their arrival. Martin Scorsese once called this film: “the most erotic picture ever…<sep>Powell & Pressburger's 1947 classic looks like it came out in 1967, a freakishly ahead of its time proto-nunsploitation drama about a group of English nuns trying to get a school-and-hospital off the ground in the Himalayan mountains. Whether it's the high altitude or the culture shock, something is in the atmosphere here electrifying these nuns until they reach a higher level of dramatic mania.

      "March Around the World, 5/30 The Criterion Challenge, Pt. II: 25/100 2000 Ranked The events of Michael Haneke's Code Unknown are bookended by scenes of schoolchildren playing charades.

In the end, a different child is up there with Haneke fading to black before any guesses can be shown. In a way,…<sep>The most cryptic movie I've seen from Haneke, an alienating watch at parts. Its clear as day and very intriguing how much of the great direction and story construction comes down to him asking the audience big questions. Or questioning the world himself, either one.

The film’s title references the fact that each character lacks the “code” to properly decipher the others’ intentions.

      "Ari Aster is the definitive One Perfect Shot filmmaker. Supported by Pawel Pogorzelski's nominally gorgeous cinematography, Aster nonetheless crafts images that look nice when screencapped and shared but are ultimately hollow and bereft of context. His films to date are structured similarly: the first 15 minutes laboriously, transparently establish the theme, at which point that theme is broadly forgotten for the next 90-100 minutes as Aster follows increasingly inert and meaningless text-level subplots, then the last 15-20 minutes return to…<sep>The director's cut blew me away!

The script is simple and elegant, but captures a rugged shimmer of harshness within the characters. Rick Blaine is one of the greatest protagonists ever created by Hollywood.

      "Just like going to the theater to see a play, Dogville works as a deep journey into the cruelty of the human heart, told in a very original and unique way that only Von Trier could have handled so amazingly. As always, the conclusion is a condemnation of the direction that humanity is heading towards to, and the colors used in the nightmarish scenarios resemble those that Kurosawa would use in Kagemusha, only darker. 90/100<sep>bu filmin üzerine saatlerce konuşulur o da yetmez kitap bile yazılır.. izlediğim ilk trier filminde inanılmaz beğenimi kazandı.. oldukça kendine has bir tarzda adeta bir tiyatro oyunu izliyormuşuz gibi gerçekliği tüm çıplaklığıyla tokat gibi çarpıyor yüzümüze dogville.. sanki dünyada iyiliğin olmadığını, freud'un düşüncesindeki gibi her insanın doğuştan kötü olarak dünyaya geldiğini müthiş bir şekilde anlatıyor film.. varlıklı, suçlu ve mafya olan babasının yanından kaçıp bir kasabaya, iyi insanların yanında kendine bir yer edinmeye çalışan ve dünyayı daha iyi bir yere…<sep>Lars von Trier films are famous for being challenging, artistic, and unconventional, but “Dogville” might be his most stylistically extraordinary movie. It pushes the limits of the medium and breaks down the boundaries between film and theater. I think it´s safe to say that I haven´t seen anything like it before. The minimalist stage-like set seems to comment on the artificiality of cinema, while also giving the story a strong air of universality.

To think I had foolishly put off viewing this wondrous film for all of these years based on the knowledge it had embraced the format of a minimalist play filmed entirely inside a soundstage is mind boggling!

I reviewed it at considerable length back then, for both Time Out New York and Esquire,…<sep>Because of its 3 hours runtime and because of the fact that I have never watched a Lars von Trier movie before, Dogville was a movie that I scare of and doubt watching. Today, finally I succeeded to forget all of these fears and watched it. I can easily say that it became one of my all time favorites. Yes, it is long, but It didn’t bother me. Pace wasn’t slow, there weren’t any unnecessary or unnecessarily long scenes.
