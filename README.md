a quick project that I worked on that uses review data and any given user's ratings to predict what score a user would give based on public reviews

nothing too useful from the trained models, I'll want to reapproach the problem again soon and hopefully develop something more helpful/insightful (whenever I find the time ðŸ˜¬)
